# Decision Trees and Random Forests â€“ Regression & Classification

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for teaching and exploring **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** models using standard datasets.

You will learn how to:
- Use Decision Trees for **regression** 
- Use Decision Trees for **classification** 
- Visualise trained trees and feature importances
- Evaluate models using standard metrics
- Extend to **Random Forests** for improved performance and robustness
